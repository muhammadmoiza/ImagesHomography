## About Homography
Homography can map or project a pixel at point A to another point B, corresponding to its homography relation. Through this homographic relation, a whole image can be skewed, stretched, resized or translated. Homography is the relation of a pixel or collectively an image with itself, before and after its projection. This relation can be calculated using coordinates of pixels, atleast four pixels.
